# Oracle Patch Downloader

The Oracle Patch Downloader can be used to download a list of
patches from My Oracle Support (MOS).

It is written in Java and based on
[HtmlUnit](https://www.htmlunit.org/), which has the big
advantage that it simulates a browser very closely, including
execution of JavaScript.  This should (hopefully) allow for more
stable web scraping, even if Oracle should decide to change
anything in the logon or download procedure.  However, using
HtmlUnit comes with the disadvantage that this tool requires the
inclusion of quite some dependencies, resulting in a relatively
big executable jar.

There are other similar tools available, for example
[oracle_quarter_patch_downloader](https://github.com/lucaslellis/oracle_quarter_patch_downloader)
or [getMOSPatch](https://github.com/MarisElsins/getMOSPatch).

The Oracle Quarter Patch Downloader provides additional logic to
download important database and GI patches based on the Automated
Release Update (ARU) catalog.  However, it is controlled by input
files, while this tool is completely command-line-driven and,
hence, slightly more scripting-friendly.

## Prerequisites

- My Oracle Support Account
- JRE version >= 1.8
- JDK version >= 1.8 and Maven version >= 3.5.4 (only if you plan
  to build the Oracle Patch Downloader yourself from its sources)

## Usage

Download the latest release of the Oracle Patch Downloader jar
from its [GitHub release page](https://github.com/ojehle/H35_OraclePatchDownloader/releases).
Then start it as

```
java -jar OraclePatchDownloader-1.1.2.jar
```

which should bring up the short usage description shown below.

You can use this tool to download one or more patches from MOS.
Specify the patch list and other lists on the command line either
as comma-separated lists (`-x p26749785,6880880`) or through
multiple repeated options (`-x p26749785 -x 6880880`) or through
a combination of both.

See [Section Specifying Patch Platforms and Other Selection
Criteria](#specifying-patch-platforms-and-other-selection-criteria)
on how to select the patch files to be downloaded.

```
 -h : --help        help text

 -D : --debug       debug mode

 -Q : --quiet       quiet mode

 -d : --directory   output folder, default user home

 -x : --patches     list of patches (e.g. "26749785,6880880")

 -f : --patchfile   file containing list of patches, one patch per line
                    (e.g. "p26749785", "26749785", "# comment")

 -q : --query |     list of platforms, releases, or languages
 -t : --platforms   (e.g. "226P" for Linux x86-64, "600000000063735R"
                    for OPatch 12.2.0.1.0, or "4L" for German (D))

 -r : --regex       regex for file filter, multiple possible
                    (e.g. "192[23]")

      --authmeth    MOS authentication method, one or more of "Basic",
                    "Legacy", or "IDCS", default "Basic,IDCS"

 -u : --user        email/userid

 -p : --password    password ("env:ENV_VAR" to use password from env)

 -T : --temp        temporary directory
```

### Example

```sh
export MOS_PASSWORD="my secret MOS password"
java -jar oraclePatchDownloader-1.1.2.jar -u user@h35.li -p env:MOS_PASSWORD \
     -x 26749785 -q 226P -r 1919 -d $HOME/Downloads
```

### Specifying Passwords

Specifying passwords on the command line is inherently unsafe, in
particular on multi-user systems.  You should better enter the
password interactively in the console, which is the default if
you do not specify option `--password`.

Or you can store the password in an environment variable and pass
a reference to that variable in the argument to option
`--password`, as shown in the example above.

### Specifying Patch Platforms and Other Selection Criteria

Disclaimer: This section is written mainly from the perspective
of a user who downloads *database* patches from MOS.  It is not
clear how far this section applies to non-database patches as
well.

You can use the synonymous [command line options `-q` or
`-t`](#specifying-option--q) to specify selection criteria for
all patches that you download in one invocation with the Oracle
Patch Downloader.  At a second stage, you can filter the
resulting patch files by patch file name with [command line
option `-r`](#specifying-option--r).

#### Specifying Option `-q`

The arguments to command line option `-q` (or `-t`) are query
items consisting of a numeric ID and a one-letter query term,
like this:

|           Query Item |        Query ID | Term  | Purpose            |
|---------------------:|----------------:|:------|:-------------------|
|             226**P** |             226 | **P** | select by platform |
| 600000000063735**R** | 600000000063735 | **R** | select by release  |
|               4**L** |               4 | **L** | select by language |

To calculate the overall patch selection criterion, all query IDs
specified per query term are logically ORed, and all different
query terms are ANDed.  So the following command line options:

```
-q 226P,23P -q 600000000063735R -q 0L -q 4L
```

would select the patch files to process according to the
following pseudo expression:

```
(file has platform 226 OR file has platform 23) AND
(file has release 600000000063735) AND
(file has language 0 OR file has language 4)
```

As a special case, you can specify a query item `ALL` to select
*all* patch files per patch number for processing:

```
-q ALL
```

If you specify `-q ALL`, then the downloader ignores all other,
more specific selection criteria that you also may have specified
with option `-q`.

#### Specifying Option `-r`

The arguments to command line option `-r` are patch file name
filters specified as [Java regular expressions][javare].  If you
do not specify any file name filter, then the Oracle Patch
downloader processes all patch files previously selected with
option `-q`.  Otherwise, the downloader processes only those
patch files where it can find at least one of the filter patterns
in the file name.

For example, with the following command line options:

```
-x 26749785 -q ALL -r 1919 -r '192[23]'
```

the downloader would process the following patch files:

```
p26749785_1919000DBRU_Generic.zip
p26749785_191900230418WINDBBP_Generic.zip
p26749785_1922000DBRU_Generic.zip
p26749785_192200240116WINDBBP_MSWIN-x86-64.zip
p26749785_1923000DBRU_Generic.zip
p26749785_192300240416WINDBBP_MSWIN-x86-64.zip
```

[javare]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html

#### Platform IDs for Generic Database Patches

Patch files for generic database patches, like for patch 26749785
from the example above, are registered on MOS with platform ID
2000 and in the patch inventory (`inventory.xml`) most often with
platform ID zero.  As seen in the example, you can select these
by specifying actually *any* platform ID to option `-q`.

#### Release IDs

Release IDs are not particularly helpful as selection criteria
for database patches since they tend to be lengthy and since they
change every quarter for most database patches.  For example,
release "19.22.0.0.0DBRU" has ID 60000000010115240116212, but
release "19.23.0.0.0DBRU" has ID 60000000010115240416212.  (Yes,
there *is* a pattern in these, and if you feel like using it, go
ahead.)  So to restrict the downloaded patch files to a
particular version, it is usually easier to use command line
option `-r` as explained above.

One exception to this "forget-about-the-release-ID" rule is
probably release ID 600000000063735 for OPatch 12.2.0.1.0, since
all OPatch 12.2.0.1.0 patch files get released on MOS with that
release ID.  And all other OPatch patch files labeled "18.\*" or
"19.\*", at least for patching the database, are just OPatch
12.2.0.1.0 in disguise.

#### Language IDs

Language IDs are even less helpful as selection criteria for
database patches since most database patch files are available on
MOS only with language ID zero.  Accordingly, specifying a
non-zero language ID for these will most likely produce an empty
search result.

### Authentication Methods

The Oracle Patch Downloader can log on to My Oracle Support
through different authentication methods:

- `Basic`

  Basic (but nonetheless secure) HTTPS authentication.  In
  contrast to the following methods this one does not involve
  execution of JavaScript and, hence, is the fastest of all
  methods.

- `Legacy`

  "Single-paged logon", legacy authentication method.  Most
  likely obsolete since May 2024.

- `IDCS`

  "Two-paged logon", authentication based on Oracle Identity
  Cloud Service.

By default, the downloader tries to log on through basic
authentication first and, if that fails, then through IDCS-based
authentication.

To override the authentication methods being attempted, specify
one or more of the above methods separated by commas to command
line option `--authmeth`.  For example, to force the exclusive
use of IDCS-based authentication, specify `--authmeth IDCS`.

### Debug Mode

In debug mode the Oracle Patch Downloader dumps all HTML pages
that it processes to the output folder.  In addition, it logs
HTTP requests and responses to a log file, also placed in the
output folder.  The downloader uses file names
`dump-<hex-timestamp>-<page-title>.xml` for dumps of regular
pages and file names `error-<hex-timestamp>-<page-title>.xml` for
dumps of pages it could not process.

**Note that the log file most certainly contains sensitive data,
likewise for the page dumps.**

The Downloader uses the APIs provided by HtmlUnit to dump HTML
pages and log HTTP requests and responses.  The information
retrieved through these APIs differs from the actual data sent
over the wire.

### Proxy

To use a Web Proxy, you can configure the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable as you do with others tools like curl. 

```sh
HTTP_PROXY=[http|socks5|socks4]://[user:password@]proxy_host:proxy_port/
```

## Installation

To build the Oracle Patch Downloader from its sources execute the
following commands:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ojehle/H35_OraclePatchDownloader.git
cd H35_OraclePatchDownloader
mvn package
java -jar target/oraclePatchDownloader-1.1.2.jar
```

The resulting jar is self-contained and does not require any
additional dependencies during runtime.

## Contributing

As [experience has shown][issue_14], even the smallest projects need
at least some standards.  If you plan to contribute more than
just a couple of changed lines to the Oracle Patch Downloader,
then here are some instructions on how to prepare your IDE or
editor to not cause too much reformatting trouble.

[issue_14]: https://github.com/ojehle/H35_OraclePatchDownloader/issues/14

### Eclipse

This project comes with project specific settings named `Default`
both for the Eclipse Java formatter and for Eclipse Java cleanup.
Plus it should configure Eclipse such that it runs a format on
each save of a Java source file.

Some notes on that:

- The project specific formatter and cleanup settings have been
  tested on Eclipse version 2024-03 (4.31.0).

- Ensure that the project specific settings are enabled by
  comparing `Project` &rarr; `Properties` with the following
  screenshots:

  ![Cleanup Settings](assets/eclipse-settings-cleanup.png?raw=true)

  ![Formatter Settings](assets/eclipse-settings-formatter.png?raw=true)

  ![Save Actions](assets/eclipse-save-actions.png?raw=true)

  "Enable project specific settings" should be checked on all of
  these, and on the former two screenshots "Unmanaged profile
  'Default'" should be selected as active profile.

- Probably better avoid doing full cleanups as triggered by
  `Source` &rarr; `Clean Up...`.  If you really feel you would
  need to clean up the sources in that way, do *not* use a custom
  profile, but rather the configured profile "Unmanaged profile
  'Default'" from the project as shown in the following
  screenshot:

  ![Cleanup Wizard](assets/eclipse-cleanup-wizard.png?raw=true)

- Unfortunately, Eclipse as version 4.31.0 with the given
  settings seems to behave slightly inconsistently when it
  indents or formats Java code: A continuation line of some
  wrapped line might get indented differently with `TAB`/`Ctrl+I`
  ("Correct Indentation") and with `Shift-Ctrl-F` ("Format").
  Mainly for that reason we have switched on source code
  formatting in the project's save actions.

- It is not clear to what extent the user-configured workspace
  settings from `Window` &rarr; `Preferences` can override or
  conflict with the project specific settings.  If in doubt,
  better review your changes in the Git perspective of Eclipse
  before committing them.

<!--
  == Note: In file `.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs` there are
  == two complete sets of cleanup settings, one with prefix
  == `cleanup.` and one with prefix `sp_cleanup.`.  The former
  == set is used when invoking the cleanup wizard interactively,
  == the latter set is used during the save actions.  However,
  == the cleanup done during the save actions luckily only uses
  == a very small subset of all these `sp_cleanup.*` settings,
  == namely only `sp_cleanup.format_source_code=true` and
  == `sp_cleanup.organize_imports=true`.  See also [Eclipse bug
  == 178429][eclipse_bug_178429].

### Emacs

Install package `smart-tabs-mode` from [MELPA](https://melpa.org)
and add the following to your Emacs initialization file:

```elisp
(smart-tabs-insinuate 'java)
```

Some notes on that:

- The Emacs configuration has been tested on Emacs 28.2.
